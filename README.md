SiteController
==============

A Boiler Plate framework that provides limited but speedy functionality for quickly developing web application in PHP. Can be used for prototyping before shifting to other frameworks such as CakePHP / CodeIgniter as the code is easily portable to either of the two. Focusses on the speedy creation of views that bind with the business logic on the server side. Also provides a minimal impact MVC architecture. (Although it is arguably not MVC since it is yet to include Model support) . Uses a single sitecontroller with view loaders and layouts.
